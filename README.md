## Project:  Face Detection and Eye Blurring System
### Overview
Python-based image processing system that detects faces, identifies eyes, and blurs eye regions for privacy protection.
### Motivation
Develop an automated tool to protect privacy in images by obscuring identifiable eye features.
### Technologies Used
Python, OpenCV, NumPy, scikit-learn (DBSCAN), Matplotlib
### Approach
Use Cascade Classifiers for face/eye detection, implement rotation-invariant detection, apply clustering to reduce false positives, and use circular blurring on eye regions.
### Challenges and Learnings
Accurate detection across angles, handling false positives, implementing rotation-invariance, applying localized blurring, and processing various image sizes.
### Key Takeaways
Importance of preprocessing, multi-angle detection, clustering for accuracy, balancing detection accuracy with speed, and modular design in image processing.
### Acknowledgments
OpenCV, scikit-learn, and Stack Overflow community for various insights and implementations.

## Setup Instructions

This will guide you through the process of setting up a Mamba environment and running the provided Python code to see it in action. It uses the last known working versions of Python and packages used.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) installed on your system. Mamba is a fast, cross-platform package manager.

### Steps

### Create a Mamba Environment
   
Execute the following commands:

===shell
mamba create -n [ENVIRONMENT_NAME] python=3.9.19 -y
mamba activate [ENVIRONMENT_NAME]
===

### Install Necessary Packages

===shell
# Install each with mamba and fall back to pip if necessary
python -m pkg_vers install_packages cv2 matplotlib==3.8.4 numpy==1.26.4 sklearn==1.4.2
===

### Usage

Ensure you are in your project directory.

Open the project in your IDE of choice.
